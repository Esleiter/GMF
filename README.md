### Description
This repository is the result of our participation in the NASA Challenge, where we have developed an oracle to predict geomagnetic storms. Geomagnetic storms can have a significant impact on Earth's technological and communication infrastructure, making the presence of an accurate prediction system crucial. 


Our solution is based on machine learning algorithms trained with historical data of geomagnetic events and real-time solar activity data. We have utilized advanced technologies to create a prediction model that can accurately anticipate the arrival and intensity of geomagnetic storms.

### Key Features
**Machine Learning Model:** We have trained a machine learning model using the TensorFlow library.

**Real-Time Data:** We gather real-time data on solar activity from multiple sources, including NASA and NOAA.

**User-Friendly Interface:** We have developed an intuitive user interface that allows users to obtain geomagnetic storm predictions easily.
